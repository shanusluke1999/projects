# projects
a web-based application to contribute to the welfare of stray dogs.The increase in the number of stray dogs has become a
serious issue that needs to be solved immediately.
This project is a valuable tool to improve the welfare of stray dogs. It is more like a social media platform application that
allows us to solve issues or concerns related to stray dogs, adopt stray dogs/puppies, find lost dogs, and also provide healthcare
tips gathered from veterinary doctors. There is also a fundraising & donation section for animal welfare at Pondicherry university.
